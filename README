Mordor

What is it?

Mordor is a high performance I/O library.  It is cross-platform, compiling
on Windows, Linux, and Mac (32-bit and 64-bit on all platforms).  It includes
several main areas:

* Cooperatively scheduled fiber engine, including synchronization primitives
* Streams library, for dealing with streams of data and manipulating them.
* HTTP library, building on top of Fibers and Streams, to provide a simple to
  use, yet extremely powerful HTTP client and server API.
* Supporting infrastructure, including logging, configuration, statistics
  gathering, and exceptions.
* A unit test framework that is lightweight, easy to use, but has several useful
  features.

One of the main goals of Mordor is to provide very easy to use abstractions and
encapsulation of difficult and complex concepts, yet still provide near absolute
power in weilding them if necessary.

for more usages and examples, please refer to the origin project at https://github.com/mozy/mordor.

Mordor is great but also limited. it's limited because it can not work smoothly with other libs,
if we do not implement adapters or bridges between them.

This repo tries to make mordor more useful by adding support for common-used libs in morden software develpoment.

the first step is to enhance the postgresql databse support.(Done)
the second step is to support redis.(Done)
the third step is to add session support.(Done, but can not open sourced for now)
the foutrh step is to implement skiplist.
